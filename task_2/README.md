## Task 2

## Description

Need to implement the `Linked List` and `Queue` Data structures that don't exist in Golang by default

### 1. Singly `Linked List`

Methods:

- `Insert` − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
- `Deletion` − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
- `Display` − Displays the complete list.
- `Search` − Searches an element using the id.
- `Delete` − Deletes an element using the id.

### 2. `Queue`

Methods:

- `Enqueue` - Add an element to the end of the queue
- `Dequeue` - Remove an element from the front of the queue
- `IsEmpty` - Check if the queue is empty
- `IsFull` - Check if the queue is full
- `Peek` - Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it

### *3. Add method `Sort` into each Data Structure(Optional)

It can be any sorting algorithm (including bubble sort)


### You should complete task by following steps:

1. make fork of this repo
2. create a new branch `task_2`
3. put your code into the task_2 folder, create separate folders for the data structures (`queue` and `list`)
4. commit and push your code to github
5. create PR to the master branch of the same repo(not in my!)
6. add me to reviewers
7. send me link to PR in skype

#### Let me know if you have any questions ;)
